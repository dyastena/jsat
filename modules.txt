### Extracted features:
- Accuracy (% of passed test cases)
- Runtime performance (execution time)
- Code efficiency (lines of code, complexity)
- Error count
- Code conciseness and style.

### Dynamic Point Allocation:
- The CART engine will analyze the extracted features to allocate points for each question.
- Maximum of 10 points per question.
- **10 points:** Perfect solution - fast, concise, and correct.
- **5-9 points:** Correct solution with minor issues in efficiency or style.
- **1-4 points:** Partially correct solution, demonstrating some understanding of the problem.
- **0 points:** Incorrect or no solution.

### CART engine classifies skill levels:
- 5 Levels: Beginner, Novice, Intermediate, Advanced, Expert
- Beginner: Low accuracy, high runtime, frequent errors
- Novice: Basic understanding, some errors
- Intermediate: Moderate accuracy, balanced runtime
- Advanced: High accuracy, optimized runtime, clean code
- Expert: Mastery of concepts, highly efficient and optimized code

### User Level Progression:
- Users start at the "Beginner" level.
- Point thresholds for each level:
    - Beginner: 100 points
    - Novice: 150 points
    - Intermediate: 200 points
    - Advanced: 250 points
    - Expert: 300 points
- After 3 or 5 consecutive 10-point answers, the system will prompt the user to advance to the next level.
- The user can choose to stay at the current level to "master" it.
