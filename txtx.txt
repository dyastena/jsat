### Access the Application

Open your web browser and navigate to:

- __Main page__: [](http://localhost:3000/app/index.html)<http://localhost:3000/app/index.html>
- __Signup page__: [](http://localhost:3000/app/auth/signup.html)<http://localhost:3000/app/auth/signup.html>
- __Login page__: [](http://localhost:3000/app/auth/login.html)<http://localhost:3000/app/auth/login.html>

### 3. Test the Signup Flow

1. Go to [](http://localhost:3000/app/auth/signup.html)<http://localhost:3000/app/auth/signup.html>

2. Fill in the signup form:

   - Full Name: (your test name)
   - Email: (use a valid email format)
   - Password: (create a password)

3. Click the signup button

4. You should be redirected after successful signup

### 4. Test the Login Flow

1. Go to [](http://localhost:3000/app/auth/login.html)<http://localhost:3000/app/auth/login.html>

2. Enter the credentials you just created

3. Click the login button

4. __First-time login__: You should be redirected to the role selection page (/app/auth/role_selection.html)

5. Select a role (Candidate or Recruiter)

6. You should be redirected to the appropriate dashboard:

   - Candidate → /app/candidate/practice.html
   - Recruiter → /app/recruiter/dashboard.html

### 5. Test the Gatekeeper (Direct Access)

1. Log out from your dashboard (use the logout button)
2. Log back in with the same credentials
3. __Expected behavior__: You should bypass the role selection page and go directly to your dashboard

### 6. Test Security Features

__Route Guarding:__

1. Log in as a Candidate
2. Try to manually navigate to: [](http://localhost:3000/app/admin/users.html)<http://localhost:3000/app/admin/users.html>
3. __Expected__: You should be redirected back to the candidate dashboard (route guard prevents access)

### 7. Browser Developer Console

Open Developer Tools (F12) to:

- Check the Console tab for any JavaScript errors
- Check the Network tab to see API requests to Supabase
- Check Application/Storage tab to see authentication tokens

### Important Notes

- Make sure your `.env` file has valid Supabase credentials (SUPABASE_URL and SUPABASE_ANON_KEY)
- The application connects to a real Supabase backend, so signups create actual user accounts
- If you encounter rate limits, wait a few minutes before trying again
- Check the browser console for any error messages
